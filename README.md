# [PYTHON] Cohort Analysis: How to Analyze User Retention
## I. Introduction
### 1. About Cohort Analysis
### What is cohort and cohort analysis? 
- A **cohort** is a group of users who share a common characteristic, and cohort analysis is a tool to measure their engagement over time.
- **Cohort analysis** helps to differentiate between actual improvements in user engagement and those that may be driven by growth, while vanity indicators do not provide the same level of insight.
### Three major types of Cohort
- **Time cohorts**: customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame.
- **Behavior cohorts**: customers who purchased a product or subscribed to a service in the past.
- **Size cohorts**: refer to the various sizes of customers who purchase the company’s products or services.
### Which type of cohort is for this project?
- I will focus on performing Cohort Analysis based on Time(**Time cohorts**). 
- Customers will be divided into acquisition cohorts depending on the month of their first purchase. 
- The cohort index would then be assigned to each of the customer’s purchases, which will represent the number of months since the first transaction.
### 2. Business Questions
- Using Python to analyze transaction data from Super_Sales_Store and creating a cohort that allows stakeholders to assess user engagement starting from their first transaction.
## II. Data Visualization with Python

## III. Insights
- Retention rates vary significantly by cohort. The highest retention rate is 31% for customers who registered and placed their first order in September 2018, while the lowest retention rate is 7% for customers who registered and placed their first order in January 2018 and July 2018.
- Retention rates tend to be higher for customers who register and place their first order in the middle of the year. This is particularly true for customers who register and place their first order in July, August, and September.
- Retention rates tend to be lower for customers who register and place their first order at the beginning of the year. This is particularly true for customers who register and place their first order in January and February.

## IV. Recommendations
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns to attract new customers during the middle of the year. This could include social media campaigns, email marketing campaigns, and search engine advertising.
- Offer special incentives to customers who register and place their first order in the middle of the year. This could include discounts, free shipping, or loyalty points.
- Analyze the reasons why retention rates are lower for customers who register and place their first order at the beginning of the year. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with customers.
- Implement strategies to improve retention rates for customers who register and place their first order at the beginning of the year. This could include offering more personalized customer service, providing more product education, or making it easier for customers to return or exchange products.
